# ByzantineGreekDatasets

This repository contains datasets developed by Colin Swaelens in the context of research on **Ancient and Byzantine Greek** within the [Database of Byzantine Book Epigrams (DBBE)](https://www.dbbe.ugent.be) project at Ghent University.  
The datasets are intended for use in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Digital Humanities research.

## 📂 Contents

- **Dataset 1: [lingAnn_GS_medievalGreek]**  
  Example: a 10,000-token gold standard annotated for part-of-speech, morphology, and lemmatisation.

- **Dataset 2: [STS_benchmark_medievalGreek]**  
  Example: a benchmark of 300 verse pairs annotated for semantic textual similarity (STS) via comparative judgement.

## 🔍 Research Context

These datasets were created to support experiments in:
- Automatic linguistic annotation (POS tagging, morphology, lemmatisation)  
- Similarity detection in medieval Greek poems
- Development of specialised transformer models (e.g., **DBBErt**)  

More details can be found in the publication on the bottom of the page
